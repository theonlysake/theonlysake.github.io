# IMPORTANT NOTICE

Whenever you change the site you must modify the "index.html" file and commit after all other commits. If you don't have actual changes, I recommend adding or removing a blank line.

For some reason, GitHub Pages tend to be completely cached by browsers. This is an obvious problem as we would like people who have previously visited the site to see the changes. Luckily, simply modifying the "index.html" file overrides the caching done by the browsers.
